# Motivation
I don't really have the best of memories and writing has been something I very much enjoy. So it will be an excuse to remember things and keep life a little more interesting! I will use this space to indulge myself and with any luck, people will find value in it. I will put here one of two things:

- Content that helps you get unstuck:
These are the answers you desperately need when you know what you want to accomplish, but tools or circumstances become obstacles. Whenever I make it out of such a hole, I will document the processes here so other people wil have an easier time climbing out.

- Content for a shift in perspective:
A change my mind kind of thing, breaking through misunderstandings you didn’t even know you had. All of us have changed many times throughout our lives and often things would have been better had we changed sooner.

# Who Am I?
I’m yet another third world programmer, navigating the internet's opportunities and challenges.

For me, the internet is not just a tool but a lifeline. It connects me to resources, knowledge, and opportunities I’d otherwise never have access to, directly shaping my livelihood.

For you, the internet might not feel as crucial, but its importance will only grow over time. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a curious learner, or a local business owner, learning to master the internet can make a real difference in your life. That's where I help.
