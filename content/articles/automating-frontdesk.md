- **Industry:** IT Training & Placement
- **Key Contact:** Anna, Project Manager
- **Customers:** Recent graduates (often with complex visa statuses) and IT professionals seeking training and placement support


### Key results summary
-   24/7 automated booking and tier‑1 support
-   Real‑time CRM logging with transcripts and outcome tags; native calendar/booking integration
-   `$0.08` per call (typical [60–90] sec; usage‑based)


## The Challenge
![Disappearing GIF](/disappear.gif)
Anna and her team wanted a seamless, modern solution for handling front desk duties without relying on costly human personnel.

Traditional support was expensive. Staff struggled with constant context switching between:

- CRM updates
- Consultation scheduling
- Ticket management
- Multichannel communication (email, phone, chat)

These repetitive tasks drained resources and slowed response times, undermining both cost-efficiency and the company’s modern, tech-forward brand.

## The Goal
Replace the front desk with an AI-driven solution that:

- Delivers ≥95% successful task completion/containment
- Integrates with CRM, ticketing, email, and VoIP
- Reduces support costs meaningfully
- Is demo‑ready in 2 weeks, with full rollout within 6 weeks

## How We Did It
![Disappearing GIF](/jump.gif)
1. **Agile MVP, fast**
- First working product delivered by end of week 1
- Demo‑ready agent with a dummy CRM shipped in 2 weeks (on deadline)
2. **Rapid iteration for real needs**
- Frequent collaboration with Anna’s team; fast feedback and sandbox/production access
- Iterations every ~3 days adding key integrations, simplifying flows, and boosting reliability
- System tuned to achieve the ≥95% success benchmark
3. **Full-Scale Deployment & Training**
- Final stack: ElevenLabs voice (with Twilio), custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, and n8n orchestrating multiple microservices
- Integrated with Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365 CRM, Outlook calendar, and custom AI tools
- Delivered Loom walkthroughs and full documentation
- Handoff included training plus optional ongoing maintenance

## The Results
AI Front Desk went live on schedule:
- Human workload for basic support and scheduling dropped significantly
- Customer satisfaction increased as response times and booking efficiency improved
- Staff could now focus on higher-value personal engagement and case management
| Before (Manual Support)      | After (AI-powered Automation)         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| High recurring costs         | Major labor savings                   |
| Error-prone integrations     | Seamless, automated cross-system flow |
| Slow bookings/ticketing      | Fast, self-serve for students         |
| Hard to scale                | Ready for future outbound automation  |

## Key Takeaways
- Prototype-to-demo in 2 weeks showed what was possible and got the team aligned.
- Fast persistent iteration led to a high-reliability solution despite initially “vague” requirements.
- Technical adaptability enabled integration with complex, previously siloed services.
- Support can now scale, and the business looks and feels like tech leaders

>“Noah was fast, communicative, and cracked every integration... some of which we worried weren’t even possible. Our complicated set of needs felt manageable for the first time. Staff and students love the new system.”
