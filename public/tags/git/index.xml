      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, something quiet but significant has been shifting in how I think about writing software. It’s a growing realization that feels less like a sudden insight and more like a path I&amp;rsquo;m still walking: that maybe, just maybe, the goal isn&amp;rsquo;t just to solve the problem in front of you, but to build something that could last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first started coding, everything felt temporary. Projects were quick sprints – homework due tomorrow, a script to get rid of an annoying manual task, a side idea I knew I&amp;rsquo;d probably drop next week. My focus was simple: make it run. Structure, naming things well, comments – that all felt like nice-to-haves I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for. Get it working, move on. And for a while, that approach worked well enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
