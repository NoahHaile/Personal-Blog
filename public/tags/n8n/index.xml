      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a while, my pride told me visual builders weren’t for &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; engineers. I never said it out loud, but I thought it: drag-and-drop tools were suitable for prototypes, business folks, or anyone trying to avoid writing &lt;em&gt;conventional&lt;/em&gt; code. They weren’t for people who knew how to build things &lt;strong&gt;the established way.&lt;/strong&gt; Then I started using n8n to build AI agents, and it didn’t take long before my conviction began to waver. Because pretty quickly, I realized that instead of a limitation, this was a superpower.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
